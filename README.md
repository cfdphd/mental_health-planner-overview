Public overview of my Mental Wellness Planner web app

## Project summary

The Mental Wellness Planner is a web‑based companion designed for busy women over 50 who want practical, evidence‑informed tools to lift mood, ease pain, and stay active. 

It combines short daily check‑ins, 5‑minute movement and breathing sessions, and simple reflection prompts into one streamlined dashboard, so users can see patterns and make small, sustainable changes. 

Originally developed as my CS50W capstone, the app is now evolving into a product‑ready platform that blends my background in transonic aeroelasticity, movement science, yoga, and mental‑health coaching.

## Problem & motivation

Most mental‑health apps are either generic habit trackers or intensive therapy tools, and very few are designed with women over 50—and their real constraints of pain, fatigue, and caregiving responsibilities—in mind. 

My clients often juggle fluctuating energy, joint pain, and mood changes, and they are overwhelmed by scattered advice, long workouts, and complex journaling systems they cannot sustain.

As a coach and engineer, I wanted a practical, data‑informed way to help them notice patterns between mood, movement, sleep, and stress without adding more cognitive load. 

The Mental Wellness Planner grew out of that need: a focused, compassionate tool that turns tiny daily check‑ins and 5‑minute movement breaks into actionable insights, so women can feel better in their bodies and minds with the time and energy they actually have.

## Key features

- **Daily check‑ins:** Simple mood, energy, and pain sliders that take under a minute to complete, designed for consistent use even on difficult days.
- 
- **5‑minute movement sessions:** Curated, low‑impact movement and breathing prompts that can be done in small spaces without equipment, tailored to women over 50.
- 
- **Ideas to lift your mood:** Context‑aware suggestions (movement, reflection, self‑care, or connection) drawn from the user’s own preferences plus a curated library.
- 
- **Progress dashboard:** Clean visual summaries of recent check‑ins and sessions, helping users see trends instead of getting lost in raw data.
- 
- **Gentle accountability:** Friendly reminders and “great job” feedback that encourage consistency without guilt or perfectionism.
-   
- **Therapist/coach‑friendly design:** Data and flows structured so health professionals can quickly understand a client’s patterns during sessions.
